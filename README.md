# 🌊 Smart River Guardian — Hackster Hackathon Article Drafts

Welcome to the **Smart River Guardian** GitHub repository.  
This repo is dedicated to drafting and organizing the article that will be published on **Hackster.io** as part of the [Hackster Earth Guardians Contest](https://www.hackster.io/contests/earthguardians/).

## 📖 Project Overview
**Smart River Guardian** is an IoT + AI solution designed to monitor and protect river ecosystems.  
The goal is to combine **low-power hardware**, **solar energy harvesting**, and **edge intelligence** to track water quality in real time and share insights for environmental stewardship.  

This repository serves as the **workspace for writing the article**, which will be split into smaller sections and then merged into a single publication.

## 📝 Article Drafts
The article is split into multiple markdown files under `/article-parts`.  
Each file covers one section of the final article:

- `01-introduction.md` — Project context & motivation  
- `02-hardware.md` — Hardware selection & setup  
- `03-software.md` — Firmware, cloud, and ML components  
- `04-design-decisions.md` — Why we chose these approaches  
- `05-results.md` — Demos, tests, and outcomes  
- `06-future-work.md` — Next steps & scaling ideas  
- `07-conclusion.md` — Wrap-up and reflections  

These parts will later be compiled into a **single article** and published on Hackster.
