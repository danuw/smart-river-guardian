# 07 â€” Conclusion

Wrap-up and reflections.

Draft content goes here.


This project has been a great motivation for me to finally look more closely at creating a water quality solution.

The many challenges encountered through that projects led to a revised scope and many areas to explorer and improve:
- load more onto the PCB to create a (much) more compact solution
- standalone challenges - through battery and power needed to maintain the sensors in a good state
- the integration of more sensors as more data points are needed to inform better decisions
- relevance of the data collected to train a TinyML model and get relevant decisions
- location based discrepancies and dataset richness
