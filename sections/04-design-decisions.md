# 04 â€” Design Decisions

With the design of the PCB in mind and the will to get something working, I realised getting a PCB working the first time, I would need to keep it as straight forward as possible. That meant minimal wiring with possibility of mistakes, prototype on breadboard first, a minimal set of sensors to limit the possibilities of failure (much easier to improve a working prototype and build with new working increments, than to fix something complex trying to make everything work at once).

Anyway, let's understand what sensors are needed to
